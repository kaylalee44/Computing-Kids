==VOCABULARY==
-Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) - several layers of 
convolutions with nonlinear activation functions applied to the results
-Natural Language Processing (NLP)
-Convolution - multiply a matrix's values element-wise with the 
original matrix, then sum them up. To get the full convolution, 
do this for each element by sliding the filter over the whole matrix
-Location Invariance - "Because you are sliding your filters over the 
whole image you don’t really care where the elephant occurs."
-(Local) Compositionality - "Each filter composes a local patch of 
lower-level features into higher-level representation."
-Token - word or character
-Stride size - defining how much you want to shift your filter at
each step
-Channels - different "views" of your input data 

==NOTES==
-CNN automatically learns the values of its filters
-A larger stride size leads to fewer applications of the filter and a smaller output size.
-Convolutions and pooling operations lose information about the 
local order of words
-Compile defines the loss function, the optimizer and the metrics.
You need a compiled model to train (because training uses the loss 
function and the optimizer). But it's not necessary to compile a 
model for predicting.
-A summary is a text output that is generated from one or more 
texts that conveys relevant information from the original text in 
a shorter form. The goal of automatic text summarization is to 
transform the source text into a shorter version using semantics.
-keras.evaluate() is for evaluating your trained model.
-Structure of a neural network. A neural network is a simplified 
model of the way the human brain processes information. It works 
by simulating a large number of interconnected processing units 
that resemble abstract versions of neurons. The processing units 
are arranged in layers.
-one epoch = one forward pass and one backward pass of all the 
training examples. 
-batch size = the number of training examples in one 
forward/backward pass.
-A recursive neural network is a kind of deep neural network 
created by applying the same set of weights recursively over a 
structured input, to produce a structured prediction over 
variable-size input structures, or a scalar prediction on it, by 
traversing a given structure in topological order.
