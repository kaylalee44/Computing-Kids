<br/>
<b><i>Keeping Washington Clean and Evergreen</i></b><br/>
</p><p>
Protecting Washington State's environment for current and future generations is what we do every day at Ecology. We are a culture that is invested in making a difference. If you want to join a team that is highly effective, collaborative, has leadership that embraces the value of people, and believes in the fun factor, Ecology is a good fit.<br/>
<br/>
The Hazardous Waste and Toxics Reduction (HWTR) Program within the Department of Ecology is looking for a <b>Regulatory and Policy Analyst</b>. This position is located in our Headquarters Building in Lacey, WA.</p>
We are looking for applicants who enjoy assisting staff and the regulated community to resolve complex dangerous waste management problems, and who also enjoy diving deep into equally complex regulations to find the best, most consistent solutions to those problems. Applicant who are self-assured but also curious and open minded, who think independently along linear and practical tracks, will be best suited for this type of work.<br/>
<br/>

<div><b>Duties</b></div><br/>
<p></p><div><br/>
<br/>
<div>The Hazardous Waste and Toxics Reduction (HWTR) Program is made up of people dedicated to fostering sustainability, preventing pollution, and promoting safe waste management. We do many different things in a coordinated approach to protect the people and environment of Washington from pollution from hazardous products and waste.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Why join the team?</b><br/>
<br/>
Join our team of diverse experts dedicated to supporting staff in the regional offices around the state in creating clear regulatory requirements, guidance and policies that are designed to protect the public and environment from mismanaged Dangerous Waste. At our best, we work as a unified team working to resolve difficult problems and meet expectations of staff and the regulated community. Together, we:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Coordinate within the agency to identify problematic areas within the Dangerous Waste rules, and create viable solutions for consistent implementation.
</li><li>Work with stakeholders to explore the intent of federal and state statues and rules in order to develop policy-based solutions for how these rules can be enforced in an environmentally sound, realistic, and economically viable way.
</li><li>Develop clear, implementable, and enforceable permits for complex facilities that treat, store, dispose and/or recycle dangerous waste.
</li><li>Update the dangerous waste rules to stay consistent with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) rules.
</li><li>Protect tax payers by requiring high risk dangerous waste processing and recycling facilities have funds set aside for emergencies or accidents.
</li><li>Ensure public participation in rulemaking and cleanup processes.
</li><li>Support Environmental Justice inclusion throughout the agency.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<b>What does the Regulatory and Policy Analyst do?</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>Conducts detailed research into the intent of the federal and state hazardous waste and dangerous waste rules in order to recommend appropriate solutions to complex dangerous waste management problems.
</li><li>Clearly and concisely explains to the public or inspectors how difficult regulations apply in a way that is legally defensible and meets the regulatory intent.
</li><li>As necessary, drafts new guidance, policy or rule amendments with the goal of ensuring human health and the environment are adequately protected.
</li><li>Serves as the program journey-level fertilizer coordinator responsible to review all applications for waste derived fertilizers and micronutrients.
</li><li>Serves as the journey-level rule writer for dangerous waste rule amendments and EPA authorization specialist.
</li><li>Develops a high level of understanding and background knowledge of the dangerous waste regulations, in order to best assist staff as they implement the rules.</li></ul><br/>
<b>
What kinds of problems will you work to solve?</b><br/>
<br/>
The Dangerous Waste rules were written for a broad group of businesses that create dangerous waste as they make products or provide services. Due to the broad reach of the regulations and diverse types of wastes, individual interpretations are often needed for new waste streams or processes that weren't known when these rules were written in 1976. This position is responsible for researching and implementing the regulations as they apply to new waste streams and processes. This may involve developing new policy or rules to ensure human health and the environment are protected.<br/>
<br/>
