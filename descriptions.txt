--You don't need to edit any code, you can just run each cell and it should work as long as you have the dsci folder with all the files and mounted your drive correctly (when mounting your drive make sure that the account that your on is the one that you give access to so that it can find the dsci folder and files). Run all the cells that define functions, and then you have the option to run the cell that pulls all the information, the job roles, and skills individually if you'd like or if you already have a data set (as long as you change the file name that's read in)
